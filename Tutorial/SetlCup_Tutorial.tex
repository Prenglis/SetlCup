%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% ==> Some hints are following:

%\chapter{Some small hints}\label{hints}
%
%\section{German Umlauts and other Language Specific Characters}\label{umlauts}
%You can type german umlauts like 'ä', 'ö', or 'ü' directly in this file.
%This is also true for other language specific characters like 'é', 'è' etc.
%
%There are problems with automatic hyphenation when using language
%specific characters and OT1-encoded fonts. In this case, use a
%T1-encoded Type1-font like the Latin Modern font family (\verb#\usepackage{lmodern}#).
%
%
%\section{References}\label{references}
%Using the commands \verb#\label{name}# and \verb#\ref{name}# you are able
%to use references in your document. Advantage: You do not need to think
%about numerations, because \LaTeX\ is doing that for you.
%
%For example, in section \ref{dividing} on page \pageref{dividing} hints for
%dividing large documents are given.
%
%Certainly, references do also work for tables, figures, formulas\ldots
%
%Please notice, that \LaTeX\ usually needs more than one run (mostly 2) to
%resolve those references correctly.
%
%
%\section{Dividing Large Documents}\label{dividing}
%You can divide your \LaTeX-Document into an arbitrary number of \TeX-Files
%to avoid too big and therefore unhandy files (e.g. one file for every chapter).
%
%For this, you insert in your main file (this one) for every subfile
%the command '\verb#\input{subfile}#'. This leads to the same behavior
%as if the content of the subfile would be at the place of the \verb#\input#-Command.
